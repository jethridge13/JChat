The script file is a .pyw file so it runs without the console on Windows. I have not yet tested if that works on Linux
as well.

Events that are always printed:
-Server is started
-A user logs on to the server
-A user logs off from the server

Events that are only printed when verbose is ticked:
-The full IP address of the server is printed
-The login thread starts
